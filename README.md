# 3D-Spring-Collision-Simulation-with-Two-Spheres-VPython
This simulation models the interaction of two spheres connected by a spring in 3D space using VPython. It visualizes their motion, velocity, momentum, and energy (kinetic, potential, and total mechanical) as they collide and exchange energy via the spring.
